    <p class="a"><a>He debuted in first class and List A Cricket in the season of 1999–2000.
        In India's domestic cricket Dhoni played for the two state teams that is Bihar and Jharkhand cricket team.
        He also played for India A, Air India Blue, Indian Board President's XI, Rajasthan Cricket Association President's XI, East Zone, Rest of India, East zone under 19, Chennai Super Kings, Rising Pune Supergiant teams.
        In BCCI Corporate trophy he played for Air India airlines' "Air India team" until his resignation from the company in 2013.[133][134][135] In 2003-04 Vijay Hazare trophy, he scored a century against Assam. On 8 February 2005 Dhoni played for India seniors in Challenger trophy, where he scored 102 nout out against India B.[136] In 2009, BCCI Corporate trophy, Dhoni scored 106 runs while playing for Air India Blue team against 'India Revenue team'. In the inning he hit 7 sixes and 7 fours at Chandigarh.[135] Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) appointed him captain of the Jharkhand team in February 2017 for the 2017-18 Vijay Hazare trophy. On 25 February 2017, he scored his first ever List-A (One day) century playing for Jharkhand; against Chhattisgarh cricket team he scored 107 runs. He lead the team to the quater final and scored 70 (108) not out in QF but Jharkhand lost against Delhi due to batting collapse.
        As teams all over the world tried to work a way around his fireworks, Dhoni established himself as a reliable batsman in Tests too, with a technique that worked against pace, seam, swing and spin. In his 5th Test, he coincidentally scored another 148 against Pakistan in an</a>></p>

    <p class="a">uncharacteristically stoic effort to save the match, thereby portraying his versatility as a batsman. After a string of wicketkeeper-batsmen being tried in the side, Dhoni had finally become a mainstay in the side - a powerful pinch-hitter towards the end of the innings capable of more than just cameos, and a more-than-reliable wicketkeeper in the side.
        After the World Cup, the Indian team saw a difficult transition period. Dhoni's shrewd captaincy came under severe scrutiny during the 8 successive losses in England and Australia. In the aftermath of the overseas failures, which included England toppling them over as the number 1 Test side in the world, a fatigued Indian side faced a 1-2 drubbing against England at home as India's Test team hit rockbottom. The team's abysmal performances in the longer format raised serious questions about Dhoni's leadership and a whisper of his sacking; a somewhat misplaced and impulsive proposition, given the poor overall performance of the entire team, their inept technique against spin (which is their forte), an overflowing timetable, and a plethora of viable explanations.
        However, the transition phase in Indian cricket saw the famed batting line-up failing to meet their lofty standards, and a rather raw bowling fast-bowling line-up with negligible experience struggling, as Zaheer Khan suffering from a long-term injury.
        However, after taking some tough selection calls, Dhoni led the way in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a marathon 224 in Chennai, setting the platform for a clean-sweep of Australia at home, clinically blanking them to regain the trophy. India became the first team in more than 40 years to whitewash Australia in a Test series and Dhoni now had the most Test wins for an Indian captain under his belt.

India's poor Test form had unfortunately seeped into the ODI fold as well. However, Dhoni developed an uncanny ability to play a symbolic game of poker during run-chases, and backing himself to finish it off in the last over without blinking. He repeated this feat multiple times: whacking a 112-meter six to clear the Adelaide boundary with 12 to win off 4 in the CB series, chasing down 15 in the last over in the Celkon Cup final to name a few, and a ridiculous 23 off the last over in a run-chase off Axar Patel to win a dead-rubber in IPL 2016; with the equation at 12 to win from 2, he dropped jaws by clouting two sixes to pull off a scarcely believable victory.

He had started to build a reputation of being one of the most reliable batsmen limited-overs cricket, taking India to victory constantly from the jaws of defeat. For instance, his century batting at No.7 against Pakistan at Chennai, a stunning 113 walking into the crease when India were 29 for 5, was a knock that symbolized the leader MS Dhoni who led by example, as well as exhibited sharp tactical nous: a much sought-after combination in a captain.</p>

    <h2 class="b">DHONI's Captaincy</h2>
    <p class="c pare"><b>With a mature head on his shoulders and an astute and shrewd cricketing mind, Dhoni was recommended by senior players like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid for captaincy after Rahul Dravid stepped down as skipper.
        On his first assignment in the inaugural World T20 in 2007, Dhoni and his young troops romped to the title in a shock victory for the inexperienced Indian side, bringing about the T20 revolution in India. Dhoni's calm and composed leadership was widely lauded in the cricketing fraternity after India brought the trophy home, earning him the label of ‘Captain Cool’. He was soon handed the ODI leadership as a natural move after his World T20 triumph, and after the retirement of Anil Kumble in late 2008, the Test leadership was thrust upon him too.
        Dhoni had a golden run as captain, with an unbeaten run in Test series since his captaincy debut, leading them to their first stint as the top-ranked Test team in the world. His winning streak included the home series against Australia in 2008, a 1-0 triumph in New Zealand in 2009, and a 2-0 victory against Sri Lanka at home, culminating in a comprehensive win at the Brabourne stadium, Mumbai, where he received the coveted Test Championship mace. India continued to dominate in home Tests after this and drew a series in South Africa, coming very close to their maiden series win in South Africa in the decider in Cape Town, where some stoic resistance by the hosts narrowly saved them from the a defeat at the hands of a rampaging Indian side in top form.</b>></p>

    <h2 class="b">DHONI's IPL Career</h2>
    <p class="a par">MS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings is a great yellove story. Ever since the Indian Premier League idea spread vigorously among the cricketing fraternity, people wondered which team would pouch the then Indian captain. The Super Kings, run by an organisation that knew the nuances of running sports, knew they wanted a strong leader to lay a strong base and they made a grand opening by bagging Dhoni for a whopping 6 Crore, the highest bid back then. The IPL would be born on April 18, 2008 and on June 1, Dhoni was there leading CSK in the final, albeit in a losing cause in a final-ball finish.
        The result may not have gone his way, but he made a mark with his captaincy and by finishing as the side's second highest run-getter. CSK were stopped one step before the final in 2009, but a year later, Dhoni made a quirky move against Kieron Pollard in the final against Mumbai Indians by placing a straightish mid-off despite having a long-off to get his hands on the coveted trophy after two failed attempts. With three consistent years, Dhoni ensured the team made a big mark and they were considered the invincibles of the IPL. CSK justified the tag by winning the title in 2011 and came runners up in the following two editions.
        Dhoni was the third highest run-getter in 2013, a season where he fought a lone battle against Mumbai in the final. His team team suffered a tough loss in Qualifier 2 against a rampant Kings XI Punjab in 2014, another year where Dhoni scored in excess of 350 runs. 2015 was a black mark in CSK's history as the team was hit by the spot-fixing saga, but Dhoni led the side to the final among the ruckus, before the franchise was slapped with a two-year ban.
        The ban meant all the CSK players were to spread and Dhoni moved to the newly formed Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016. He spent a quite year, but was back doing what he does best, leading his side to the final, but yet again, finished runners-up in a heart-breaking loss to the Mumbai Indians in the final.
        2018 was a grand re-entry for Dhoni and CSK. The franchise was given an unimaginably rousing welcome by the fans, who even took a train all the way from Chennai to Pune to support the team as the matches had to be moved out of Chennai. Dhoni was back to where he belonged. He looked fresher, fitter and hungrier. With his brilliant power-hitting through the season, he silenced critics who ever questioning his hitting prowess and made a strong statement that he is still well and truly alive for the 2019 World Cup.
        After a heart-breaking 1-run loss in the 2019 IPL final to Mumbai, Dhoni led CSK to their 4th title in 2021. Dhoni stepped down from CSK captaincy but he got it back from Ravindra Jadeja after a disastrous 2022 season which saw them not qualify for the playoffs. Dhoni will be back for the 2023 season and will captain the side.

    <h2 class="b">Why Dhoni is called the "BEST CAPTAIN" </h2>
    <p class="a pare">One of Dhoni’s biggest assets as a captain is his capacity to maintain composure in stressful situations. He is renowned for his capacity for clear thinking and rapid decision-making under duress. This was seen in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 final, as India was down to its final over against Pakistan. The Indian team’s skipper, Dhoni, kept his composure and guided India to a resounding victory. Dhoni’s career was forever changed by this incident, which also cemented his reputation as a calm and collected leader.
        Dhoni’s leadership style also sets a positive example for his teammates. His cool, collected demeanor on the field influences his teammates and inspires confidence in them. This was evident in the 2010 Asia Cup final when India was far behind Sri Lanka. Despite the odds, India went on to win the match by two runs, thanks to Dhoni’s controlled and collected demeanor, which helped his teammates stay focused.
        Another defining quality of Dhoni’s leadership is his ability to read the game accurately. He is known for making tactical adjustments that can change the outcome of a game. His ability to read the field and understand the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition enables him to make wise decisions. This was clearly demonstrated in the Commonwealth Bank series in 2007–2008, where India was losing to Australia. Thanks to Dhoni’s tactical adjustments, India became the first Indian team to win a bilateral ODI series in Australia.
        Dhoni is also known for his ability to handle criticism with grace. He accepts criticism well and continues to perform, a crucial trait for a captain as it allows him to stay focused on the task at hand and prevent distractions from affecting his performance.
        In addition to his calm demeanor, Dhoni is also known for his tactical acumen and match-winning strategies. He is the only captain to have won all three ICC trophies for India – the T20 World Cup 2007, the ICC World Cup 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy 2013. His sharp mind and strategic planning have played a significant role in these victories.
        Beyond the cricket pitch, Dhoni’s influence extends to his role as the captain of the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL). His leadership has been instrumental in the team’s success, leading them to multiple victories and playoff appearances. His immense popularity in South India has earned him another affectionate nickname, “Thala”, which means leader in Tamil. The people of Chennai adore Dhoni, and his impact on the team and the city has been profound.
        Dhoni’s calm demeanor is not just limited to his on-field performance. It extends to his interactions with his team off the field as well. He ensures a peaceful environment in the dressing room, a trait that is highly appreciated by his teammates. His ability to maintain his coolness in any situation, whether winning or losing, has made him a role model for many aspiring cricketers
        Moreover, Dhoni’s calmness should not be mistaken for a lack of passion or intensity. On the contrary, his composed exterior hides a fiercely competitive spirit and a deep understanding of the game. His ability to make split-second decisions that can change the course of a match is a testament to his sharp intellect and deep knowledge of cricket.</p>
